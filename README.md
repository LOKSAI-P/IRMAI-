📈 Stock Trade Outlier Analysis using Graph Database
🔍 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze foreign exchange (FX) trades, identify outliers, and compare actual trading patterns against expected guidelines using Neo4j (Graph Database).

🎯 Objectives
📊 Data Collection
Collect historical FX trade data for various currency pairs (e.g., EUR/USD, GBP/USD) from public APIs or CSV files.
Store the collected data in Neo4j for efficient querying and analysis.
🛠 Graph Construction
Represent each trade as a node, with edges indicating relationships between trades (e.g., consecutive trades or trades with similar characteristics).
Enrich nodes with attributes like trade volume, price, and timestamp to provide context.
🚨 Outlier Detection
Use statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, Interquartile Range) to identify trades that significantly deviate from normal patterns.
Highlight outliers in the graph for further analysis.
📏 Comparison with Expected Guidelines
Define expected trading patterns based on historical data & market norms.
Analyze actual trading behavior to assess compliance with these guidelines.
📊 Visualization & Reporting
Use Matplotlib, Plotly for visualization.
Generate a comprehensive report summarizing findings & insights.
⚙ Key Features
🔄 Forex Data Fetching
  Retrieves historical forex data for EUR/USD using yfinance API.
  Fetches data hourly for a 7-day period.
🛢 Data Storage in Neo4j
  Stores forex trade data in a Neo4j graph database.
  Creates Currency nodes for EUR & USD, linked with EXCHANGE_RATE relationships.
  Stores each trade as a Trade node with price, volume & timestamp attributes.
🧐 Outlier Detection
  Calculates Z-scores for price & volume.
  Flags trades as outliers if their Z-score is beyond the threshold.
  Outliers are stored as Outlier nodes with IS_OUTLIER relationships.
🔗 Trade Relationships
  Identifies consecutive trades and stores them as CONSECUTIVE relationships.
  Links similar trades using SIMILAR relationships.
📌 Analysis & Querying
  Run queries to retrieve trade relationships, outliers, and anomalies from the database.
  Fetch consecutive trades, similar trades, and price/volume deviations.
🏗 Technologies Used
  🐍 Python – For data processing & Neo4j integration.
  📈 yfinance – Fetches historical forex data.
  🗄 Neo4j – Stores forex trades as a graph database.
  📉 Z-Score Calculation – Identifies outliers.

  ✅ Advanced Analytics – Use ML models for predicting forex prices.

🏦 Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) for Financial Transactions
🎯 Objective
This project develops a system for Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) on financial transactions, storing and visualizing the results using a graph database (Neo4j).

📌 Requirements
📊 Data Collection
Collect historical financial transactions (e.g., bank transfers, credit card transactions).
Store the data in a local Neo4j graph database.
🛠 Graph Construction
Represent each transaction as a node and edges as relationships (e.g., consecutive transactions, similar transactions).
Store attributes like amount, type, timestamp.
⚠ FMEA Implementation
Implement an FMEA algorithm to detect failure modes & their impact.
Highlight failure modes in the graph.
📊 Visualization
Use Matplotlib, Plotly to visualize the transaction graph.
Generate a report summarizing failures & risks.
🏗 Tools & Libraries
🐍 Python
🗄 Neo4j (with Py2neo or Neo4j Python driver)
📊 Pandas, NumPy
📉 Matplotlib or Plotly
🔄 Workflow
1️⃣ Data Collection – Fetch financial transaction data.
2️⃣ Graph Construction – Store transactions as nodes & edges.
3️⃣ FMEA Analysis – Detect & classify failure modes.
4️⃣ Visualization – Generate graphs & reports.

🔍 Use Cases
🚨 Fraud Detection – Identify unusual financial activities.
📈 Risk Assessment – Analyze high-risk transactions.
⚠ Failure Mode Analysis – Detect transaction failures before they escalate.
🚀 Potential Enhancements
✅ Real-time Monitoring – Detect failures in real-time.
✅ AI-powered Anomaly Detection – Use ML models for fraud detection.
✅ Automated Alerts – Notify users on suspicious activities.
